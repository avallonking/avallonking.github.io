I am Jiajin Li (Albert Lee), currently a PhD. student in [Human Genetics Program](https://genomics.genetics.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, working in [Dr. Jae Hoon Sul's Lab](jaehoonsullab.semel.ucla.edu). My research interests are developing efficient and user-friendly statistical tools for large-scale analysis of genomic data. I am also interested in learning and developing cool technologies like deep learning.

I am not only a tech guy, but also an anime fan, a gamer, a minimalist, a badminton lover and a bookworm. I like to post some interesting findings both in SciTech and my daily life.
